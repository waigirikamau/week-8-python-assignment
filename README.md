# ü¶† COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, focusing on trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The data is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/), and the analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## üö© Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare key metrics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, India, USA)
- Create visualizations such as line charts and choropleth maps
- Communicate findings through a well-documented notebook with narrative explanations

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for interactive maps)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run/View the Project

1. Download the notebook file: `COVID-19_TRACKER.ipynb`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
3. Step through each cell to load the data, process it, and view the charts and insights.
4. You can export the notebook to PDF or HTML for presentation or sharing.

## üí° Insights & Reflections

- The United States had the highest vaccination numbers but also a high number of cases and deaths.
- India showed distinct waves of infection, especially in mid-2021.
- Kenya had a slower vaccine rollout, but also lower case numbers compared to larger nations.
- Data visualization revealed trends and disparities that were not immediately obvious from raw figures.

This project demonstrates the power of open data and analytics in understanding global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
